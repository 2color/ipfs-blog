Our friends at [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) recently [launched](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/decentralizing-nft-metadata-on-opensea/) a feature to “freeze” NFT metadata, enabling NFT creators to properly decentralize their NFTs using IPFS and Filecoin. OpenSea is one of the largest NFT marketplaces in the web3 space, creating a market for millions of NFTs today. Using IPFS and Filecoin, NFT creators that use OpenSea can now create immutable NFT metadata using IPFS [content addressing](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-04-05-storing-nfts-on-ipfs/) and [provable and decentralized storage with Filecoin](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-06-03-ipfs-filecoin-content-persistence/).
