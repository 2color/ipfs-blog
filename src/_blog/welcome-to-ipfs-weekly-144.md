We're happy to announce [**the release of IPFS Cluster 0.14.0**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-07-12-ipfs-cluster-0-14-0/)! IPFS Cluster provides an overlay layer to control and orchestrate pinsets in multiple IPFS daemons. It adds content, distributes pins, tracks them, and ensures content is replicated while providing streamlined API(s) for IPFS storage management. From feedback received, the [**release of IPFS Cluster 0.14.0**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-07-12-ipfs-cluster-0-14-0/) has added CAR import support, batched-pin ingestion, and automatic garbage collection to the Badger datastore, along with other optimizations, updates, and bug fixes.
